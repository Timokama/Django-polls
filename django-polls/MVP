I am a software engineer who recently completed the Foundations curriculum at ALX School. ALX was the best fit for me because I felt that the project-based approach would be an immersive experience superior to lectures in a classroom, and the peer-learning model would train me to build strong interpersonal relationships and collaborate well with others. At ALX I learned programming concepts such as data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, and databases, as well as system engineering concepts like web stack debugging, web infrastructure monitoring, web server management, and web infrastructure design.

Polls is a Django app to conduct web-based polls. For each question, visitors can choose between a fixed number of answers. Detailed documentation is in the "docs" directory.

Outside of coding, I enjoy puzzles, Reading, playing Basketball.
